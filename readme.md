# electrical_toolbox

**electrical_toolbox** is a lightweight, pure-C library focused on generating and manipulating signals and implementing the essential math functions frequently needed in **electrical engineering, signal processing, and embedded systems.**

This project aims to offer a practical toolbox for building simulations, embedded controllers, or educational experiments â€” while staying minimal and highly portable.
